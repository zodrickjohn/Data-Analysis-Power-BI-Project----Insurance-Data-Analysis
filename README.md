### 1. Data Connection
- Imported insurance claim and policy data into Power BI from Excel.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Corrected data types for dates, numbers, and categorical fields.
- Removed missing, duplicate, or inconsistent records.

### 3. Data Modeling
- Built relationships between **Customer ID**, **Policy Number**, and **Claim Number**.
- Added new calculated columns (e.g., Claim Status categorization).

### 4. KPI Cards
- Displayed major highlights:
  - **Claim Amount**: ₹16.91M
  - **Premium Amount**: ₹5.98M
  - **Coverage Amount**: ₹600.55M

### 5. Filter Options (Slicers)
- Made it interactive with filters for Claim Number, Customer ID, and Policy Number.

### 6. Gender Distribution
- Showed a comparison between:
  - **Male**: 5003 customers
  - **Female**: 5001 customers

### 7. Visualizations Added
- 📊 Bar Chart: Premium Amount by Policy Type (Travel, Health, Auto, etc.)
- 📈 Line Graph: Claim Amount by Age Group (Adult, Elder, Young Adult)
- 🍩 Donut Chart: Active vs Inactive Policies
- 📉 Bar Chart: Number of Claims by Claim Status (Rejected, Settled, Pending)

### 8. Financial Summary Table
- Added a matrix table showing Pending, Rejected, and Settled amounts across different Policy Types.

### 9. Detailed Drill-Down Table (Next Page)
- Created a fully **drillable table** where users can explore detailed data from any visualization selection.
- Provides hierarchical deep-dives into policy details, claims, and customer information.

### 10. Theme & Styling

- Added clear titles, labels, and subtle borders around visuals.
